# Metabase Starburst Driver

## Driver Plugin Installation
The Starburst Driver `.jar` binary can be downloaded from our releases in github. Once it is downloaded, 
it must be stored in the `plugins` directory within the Metabase working dir. See: https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/developers-guide-drivers.html#how-to-use-a-third-party-driver

## App Supported Versions

Please see [supported versions](app_versions.json) for this release.

## Developers Guide Drivers

Our build scripts will git clone the Metabase repo to `./metabase` and copy all Starburst driver files into the 
expected folder: `./metabase/modules/drivers/starburst`. From here, we leverage the Metabase build scripts to 
build our `.jar` file into the correct dir, run tests, and start the local server.

### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
* [Metabase Prerequisites](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/developers-guide/build#install-the-prerequisites)

##### Quick Start
Run `make build test` to build and run tests locally. If everything passes, you're good to go!

### Building
Run `make build` to clone the Metabase repo and build all required components. This command should not need
to be run again unless you manually git pull new changes into your local Metabase repo.

#### Force Updating Metabase Repo
You can manually run git commands to update the cloned Metabase repo, but if you want to remove 
the local Metabase repo and re-clone with the latest changes, `make clean`

### Starting Local Server
Once you have built all required resources with the `make build` command, run `make server`. 
This command starts a local Metabase server on port `3000`. If you want to build the driver and then start a server, run `make driver server`.

### Testing Driver
Once you have built all required resources with the `make build` command, run `make test`. This command builds your local driver changes and then starts Starburst driver tests.

#### Staring a Trino Server in Docker 
Running `make test` will start a Trino server for you on port 8082 when needed, but if you want to start one, you can run `make start_trino_if_missing`.

*Note:* Running `make test` will populate the Trino catalogs with mock data that is used for testing. You can then connect Metabase to this Trino server to view that data. This is useful for manual testing.

#### Executing Specific Tests
You can cd into the metabase repo and run commands like:
`DRIVERS=starburst clojure -X:dev:drivers:drivers-dev:test :only metabase.query-processor-test.timezones-test/filter-test`

or even

`DRIVERS=starburst clojure -X:dev:drivers:drivers-dev:test :only metabase.query-processor-test.timezones-test`

### Releasing Driver
To create a release from the `main` branch follow the below steps.

#### 1.) Create a Release Branch
Head to actions and run the `Create Release Branch` workflow entering in the correct semantic version, and submit the workflow. This will create a new PR that contains promoted CHANGELOG.md and updated version info. Review the PR and merge once checks pass.

#### 2.) Create the Release Artifact 
Head to actions and run the `Release` workflow entering the same the same semantic version, and submit the release workflow. When this workflow completes, it will create a new tagged github release with the provided version and upload the `.jar` binary for clients to consume.

### Update Metabase Version
If needed, `make checkout_latest_metabase_tag` will update Metabase to its latest tagged release.
